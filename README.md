CHANGE: This repository contains the **embedded firmware** for the **Kratos rover platform**, developed by the **York University Rover Team (YURS)**. The firmware targets **STM32 microcontrollers** and is designed to support modular rover subsystems including IMU, fan control, headlight control and temperature sensing. The goal of this project is to provide a **robust and scalable embedded architecture** for rover control systems. By leveraging real time embedded firmware and a distributed **CAN bus network**, the system enables reliable communication between subsystem controllers while maintaining deterministic timing and low power consumption.
